    <div class="text-block">Why do We Use Social Media and Why do We Find It Addictive?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section-3">
    <p class="paragraph">Are <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Snapchat</em>, <em>Instagram</em> and other social media platforms becoming an everyday part of your life? Do you find yourself constantly being directed to them or feel the need to check them throughout the day? </p>
    <p class="paragraph-3">There are psychological reasons behind this, and these apps are designed for this exact purpose; to keep your eyes on your screen for as long and as often as possible.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-4">There are many reasons as to why we use social media, and each of these reasons has many pros and cons such as, improving our confidence and strengthening our bonds with friends and family online. However social media is a double-edged sword and problems such as depression, anxiety and addiction can also arise from using social media.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-5">Throughout this essay, I will uncover the many reasons behind why, and how we use social media platforms and the multitude of ways in which apps are designed and engineered to get us hooked. I will also explore the effects that this has on both our mental and physical health.<br></p>
    <div class="div-block-2"><img src="images/socialmedia.png" width="675" srcset="images/socialmedia-p-500.png 500w, images/socialmedia-p-800.png 800w, images/socialmedia-p-1080.png 1080w, images/socialmedia-p-1600.png 1600w, images/socialmedia-p-2000.png 2000w, images/socialmedia.png 2224w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 675px" alt="" class="image-5"></div>
    <h4 id="section1" class="heading-3">Why do we use social media?</h4>
    <p class="paragraph-6">There are both social and psychological reasons as to why we use social media. It provides us with an escape from certain structures and restraints within our society, a place to relax and allows us to loosen up more and expresses ourselves easier. It also provides us with a platform where we feel like we can say or post certain things that we would not feel comfortable doing in our normal face-to-face world.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-7">But what exactly is it that causes us to feel more open to talking about ourselves and expressing ourselves online? This can be explained by, what researchers call, the ‘<span><em class="italic-text">disinhibition effect</em></span>’, this effect tends to fall within two categories; <span><em class="italic-text-2">Benign disinhibition</em></span> and <span class="text-span"><em>toxic disinhibition</em></span>.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-8">Usually, users of social media share their inner thoughts, and emotions online and show acts of kindness and have a sense of users displaying self-growth and exploring themselves; this Is what would be described as benign disinhibition. Toxic disinhibition, however, describes users that use social media platforms to spread hate, anger, threats, and to post critical opinions about how people look, in today’s world these individuals are well known as internet trolls. </p>
    <p class="paragraph-9">John Suler, a psychology professor who has studied the behaviour of people online, explains that the disinhibition effect is caused by many factors and because of these factors he believes that cyberspace weakens the psychological barriers that hold back the release of these inner feelings and needs. <br>The main factors for this are due to <em class="italic-text-3">minimalised authority</em>, <em class="italic-text-4">invisibility</em> and <em class="italic-text-5">dissociative anonymity</em>. In plain terms, there is no figure in power, everyone online are equals, and not everyone knows who you are. This gives you the chance to present yourself as you wish. Also due to the nature of online platforms, those who you connect with or communicate with cannot see you, so by not seeing them in person, or their facial expressions, we feel more comfortable saying what we do online.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-10">A natural human impulse is to pass on information and share, it activates our brain&#x27;s reward centres and with likes, reactions and other public feedback from social media we know we have an audience and this helps our brains reward us even more. If we couldn’t see this social approval and didn’t know we had an audience would we post?<br>Personally, I believe the answer to this is no. We do not use social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram as online diaries; we use them for the purpose of sharing our lives and for observing the lives of others. By sharing our lives, we give others a better sense of who we are and what we care about, it also allows us to stay connected to our friends and family. </p>
    <div class="div-block-3"><img src="images/reactions.png" width="748" srcset="images/reactions-p-500.png 500w, images/reactions-p-800.png 800w, images/reactions-p-1080.png 1080w, images/reactions-p-1600.png 1600w, images/reactions-p-2000.png 2000w, images/reactions.png 2224w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 748px" alt="" class="image-7"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-11">The likes and reactions that we achieve from Facebook, Instagram and other platforms lie at the heart of why we use social media. Since Facebook implemented the “<span><em class="italic-text-7">Like</em></span><em>”</em> button, it has been used more than <span><em class="italic-text-6">1.13 trillion</em></span> times; it is one of the most alluring aspects of social media. By liking each other&#x27;s posts we add value to our relationships with others, and it reinforces the closeness that we have to each other and allows us to maintain these relationships, but for some users, it can become a way of basing their sense of self-worth on the number of &quot;likes&quot; that they achieve. Due to this nature, gaining likes and using social media can become <span><em class="italic-text-8">addictive</em></span> as we strive to improve our <span class="text-span-2"><em>self-worth</em></span> and maintain our relationships with our friends online.</p>
    <p data-w-id="67c0a98b-f95a-b176-2f34-810b361d1d58" class="paragraph-12">Socially, as humans, we love to talk about ourselves and share our lives with people and according to an online article by Forbes, we &quot;devote between 30% and 40% of our speech to telling others about ourselves. And when it comes to “conversations” on social media, the amount of personal information we reveal rises to a whopping 80%&quot;.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-13">Why? Because platforms such as Facebook and Instagram provide us with the stage to post and talk about ourselves, share photos and allow us to present ourselves in a positive light without having to engage in face-to-face conversations. Face-to-face conversations involve a lot of emotion and thinking, reading facial expressions and body language, with posting online we avoid this and have more time to think and refine what we are saying, this gives us time to present ourselves how we wish, and this is what researchers call <span class="text-span-3">&quot;<em class="italic-text-9">self-presentation&quot;</em></span>. <br>This idea of creating a better online version can be good for us as it lets us grow our confidence, in fact, a study by Cornell University asked stressed college students to scroll through their personal Facebook profiles for five minutes, this resulted in the students experiencing a boost in <span><em class="italic-text-10">self-affirmation</em></span>. This study states that one of the reasons as to why we use social media is, in fact, to fulfil our egos and boost our self-worth and self-integrity.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-14">However this self-presentation can become harmful,  by creating these perfect online version of ourselves and our lives, we can begin to become unauthentic, and reality can become blurred. The perfect, blemish-free photos we post can boost our self-esteem online and allow us to reel in the likes and comments online, but it can also make us feel inadequate and self-conscious in person. These perfect images and lives that people portray online give a false illusion that can be damaging to those that view these profiles on social media. The viewers and followers of these profiles can begin to compare their own lives to this false reality and see others as having perfect lives. Due to this people can develop problems such as<em class="italic-text-11"> depression</em>, <em class="italic-text-12">anxiety</em>, and <span><em class="italic-text-13">loneliness</em></span>.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-15">Personally, I have found myself comparing my life and the way I look to profiles that I have seen on Instagram and other online platforms which has resulted in making me feel self-conscious and at times has made me see myself as a failure. As a result, I try to post more online and update my Instagram more often with what I am doing with my life that seems interesting.</p>

    <h3 id="section2" class="heading-4">How Does Social Media Affect Our Mood?</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-16">Many of us use social media every day, and it can actually affect our moods. It can make us feel uplifted, happy and relaxed, but can also cause us to feel sad and depressed. Two researchers called David Ginsberg, and Moira Burke wrote an online article on <a href="#https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/hard-questions-is-spending-time-on-social-media-bad-for-us/" target="_blank"><em class="italic-text-29">Facebook&#x27;s newsroom</em></a> about how spending too much time online could be bad for us. They found that the effects on our moods caused by social media depend on how we use it. <br>‍<br>We use social media to tag our friends in <a href="#http://funnyand.com/essay-meme/" target="_blank"><em class="italic-text-30">funny memes</em></a> and<span> <em class="italic-text-31">videos</em></span>, <em class="italic-text-33">share photos</em>, <em class="italic-text-32">upload</em><strong class="bold-text-3"> </strong><em class="italic-text-34">selfies </em>and talk about our lives. It allows us to share a sense of who we are and stay connected to others. Ginsberg and Burke conducted a study and found that &quot;people who sent or received more messages, comments and timeline posts reported improvements in <em class="italic-text-14">social support</em>, <em class="italic-text-15">depression</em>, and <em class="italic-text-16">loneliness</em>.&quot;</p>
    <p class="paragraph-17">These researchers also state that if we do not engage in social media actively and instead <em class="italic-text-35">&quot;passively consume&quot;</em> the material on social media, that it can negatively affect our moods and cause depression. This is mainly due to users negatively comparing their lives, to other users they see on Facebook and Instagram that appear to have better, more exciting and happy lives. This can lead users to start negatively thinking about their looks, body image, and appearance, resulting in negative emotions. </p>
    <p class="paragraph-18">This correlation between how we use social media and how it affects our mood seems to be a common consensus between users that have researched the effects of social media on our moods. In an online article called <a href="#https://www.happier.com/blog/how-social-media-can-make-you-happier/" target="_blank"><em class="italic-text-36">“How social media can make you happier”</em></a> by Nataly Kogan, she explains that she could not understand the reason as to why she would sometimes use Instagram and come away feeling happier or end up feeling deflated or stressed out.<br>However, when she began to pay attention to how she used social media, she realised that more she interacted with others, posted comments or gave advice that she ended up feeling better, she felt better connected to others which is one of the main foundations for our emotional and physical well-being.<br>On the other hand, she also realised that when she passively scrolled through her news feeds, that her mood declined and she began to compare her life to those she saw online.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-19">What is it that causes us to feel bad about ourselves when we passively consume content online? As we look at the profiles of our friends or of those we follow, we become aware of the differences between our lives and theirs; usually, this results in the feeling of jealousy or envy. </p>
    <div class="div-block-5"><img src="images/fomo.png" width="777" srcset="images/fomo-p-500.png 500w, images/fomo-p-800.png 800w, images/fomo-p-1080.png 1080w, images/fomo-p-1600.png 1600w, images/fomo-p-2000.png 2000w, images/fomo.png 2224w" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 777px" alt="" class="image-9"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-20">If we as users find that using social media and looking at certain profiles makes us feel sad or depressed then why don’t we stop using social media or avoid these kinds of profiles? It is due to the fear of missing out or FOMO which is an interesting psychological phenomenon defined by The New York Times as &quot;<em class="italic-text-17">the blend of anxiety, inadequacy, and irritation that can flare up while skimming social media</em>&quot;.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-21">When we see all the images of our friends or followers having great lives, partying or travelling, we have the feeling that we should also be doing something right now that is equally as great, if not better. FOMO creates a desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing, and with Facebook, Instagram stories and Snapchat, we are continuously updated by other people’s lives and achievements. <br>This means that we are continuously comparing our lives to others which can result in anxiety and depression, it also creates a desire to want to do more on social media to seem more successful and exciting to achieve more likes and in turn, social approval.<br><br>In today’s world, success and happiness are measured by likes and shares. We all try to make ourselves appear perfect on social media. In a <a href="#https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44640959" target="_blank"><em class="italic-text-37">BBC news article</em></a>, Leah Pearlman, co-inventor of Facebook&#x27;s Like button, said that she had become hooked on Facebook due to the fact that she had begun basing her sense of self-worth on the number of &quot;likes&quot; she received. She also mentioned that when she feels insecure or needs validation, she would check her phone.<br><br>FOMO and social media have a cyclical relationship, using social media can cause people to experience FOMO, and when they experience FOMO it generates an addiction to social media due to this many problems can arise. We can become more interested in what everyone else is doing and become worried about what friends are doing that we may be missing out on. Instead of enjoying our own lives we tend to live and judge other people’s lives and replace happiness with envy.<br><br>However not everyone is as affected by FOMO as others may be, those who strive for perfection or who rely on the approval of others are at risk the most. Although with the growing use of smartphones more and more people are experiencing the anxiety created by FOMO and the use of social media, especially the youth of today’s generation as the approval gained from likes online are deeply engraved in their everyday life compared to that of older generations.</p>
    <div class="div-block-6"><img src="images/needle.png" width="802" srcset="images/needle-p-500.png 500w, images/needle-p-800.png 800w, images/needle-p-1080.png 1080w, images/needle-p-1600.png 1600w, images/needle-p-2000.png 2000w, images/needle.png 2224w" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 802px" alt="" class="image-10"></div>
    <h3 class="heading-5">Social media and addiction</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-22">The pull of social media isn’t all in our heads, it a real thing and is due to how our brains work. It is the result of two chemicals that our brain produces: <em class="italic-text-38">Dopamine</em> and <span><em class="italic-text-39">Oxytocin</em></span>. Dopamine creates a want to seek or search and is stimulated by unpredictability, by small bits of information, and by reward cues. When this want is satisfied, it creates a sense of pleasure for the user.<br>‍<br>Oxytocin, on the other hand, is sometimes referred to as the cuddle or love hormone which is released when we hug or kiss, it makes us feel good and happy; however it is also produced when we tweet, post a status or when we use social media. <br>With both of these hormones in action using social media makes us feel great, but it also makes it hard to stop using. <br><br>Due to the effects of FOMO, the online approval generated from likes and the hormonal rewards that come with social media we end up using our devices more and more and spend more of our time looking at our screens. It is a normal human reaction which is being exploited by the very companies that own the social media platforms that we use.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-23">&quot;It&#x27;s as if they&#x27;re taking behavioural cocaine and just sprinkling it all over your interface and that&#x27;s the thing that keeps you like coming back and back and back.&quot;</p>
    <p class="paragraph-24">This quote comes from Aza Raskin, a former Mozilla and Jawbone employee, and designer of the &#x27;<em class="italic-text-19">continuous scroll</em>&#x27; that we see on most social media platforms. Aza also added that <em class="italic-text-18">&quot;Behind every screen on your phone, there are generally like literally a thousand engineers that have worked on this thing to try to make it maximally addicting.&quot;<br><br></em>The continuous scroll is just one of many techniques used by companies to get us addicted to social media. But how does this work? Due to its nature, users can scroll and scroll and scroll without clicking and keep searching for content that they enjoy. It prevents users from having to think and is <em class="italic-text-40">habit-forming</em>. It is not inherently evil as it helps us navigate and use or apps more efficiently, but it keeps the user scrolling and using the platform in the search to find something interesting. <br>By doing this, it provides more time for the platforms to show you advertisements and sponsored content, while also learning what you are interested in so that the apps can tailor what you see on your news feeds to further show you more content for you to interact with. <br><br>The objective is to keep you on your screen because this is how the companies make money, we as users are not the customers for these platforms, companies such as Coca-Cola and Nike are, they pay Facebook and Instagram, and it is our attention which Is sold to them.<br><br>Former Google engineer Tristan Harris told &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in an interview that companies have a <em class="italic-text-41">&quot;whole playbook of techniques&quot;</em> that keep people glued to their apps and devices for as long as possible. Former Facebook president Sean Parker also criticised Facebook in an interview with CBS news saying that it is <em class="italic-text-20">&quot;exploiting a vulnerability in human society.&quot;</em></p>
    <p class="paragraph-25">One of these techniques involves using algorithms that are written specifically for individual users and has been called <em class="italic-text-21">“brain hacking”</em> by programmers. These programmers, knowing how the brain works, will write code that will encourage the brain to do certain things, such as increasing dopamine levels within the brain to create desire or pleasure. <br>Ramsey Brown, a neuroscientist, and co-founder of Dopamine Labs told Anderson Cooper in an interview that Instagram uses this technique by holding back notifications on how many likes your posts has received.<br>Their algorithms will then reveal them as a massive burst of likes at a specific time, tailored to each user, so as to provoke a neurological response. By doing this, it gains your attention and causes you to open the app and to use it for more extended periods throughout the day.</p>
    <div class="div-block-8"><img src="images/notifications.png" width="780" srcset="images/notifications-p-500.png 500w, images/notifications-p-800.png 800w, images/notifications-p-1080.png 1080w, images/notifications-p-1600.png 1600w, images/notifications-p-2000.png 2000w, images/notifications.png 2224w" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 780px" alt="" class="image-12"></div>
    <div class="div-block-7">
      <p class="paragraph-26">There are many other ways in which the apps that we use grab our attention throughout the day, such as sending push notification to our phones to let us know that someone has posted a story on Instagram or that its someone’s birthday on Facebook. These push notifications are customisable and can be stopped however they usually mean digging around your settings which can require time and effort.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph-27">The notifications that we receive from apps either as push notifications or emails are how companies try and get us hooked to their products. It is the trigger, the actuator of behaviour. In Nir Eyal’s book titled <em class="italic-text-22">‘Hooked’,</em> he describes <em class="italic-text-42">‘the hook model&#x27;</em>, a process used to build habit-forming products. The Hook Model helps us to understand how a product managed to become a habit for users. <br><br>The model consists of four phases. Firstly, you need a <em class="italic-text-23">trigger</em> to attract the users to the product. These may be external triggers such as e-mails or notifications, or user-generated triggers for products that have become habits for them, for example, this could be receiving a notification that someone has tweeted on Twitter. After triggering the users, the second step is <em class="italic-text-24">action</em>. The action phase needs to be simple, smooth and quick, by sliding or tapping the notification the user is brought into the app to view the tweet. After the users take action, you need to greet them with <span><em class="italic-text-25">rewards</em></span>. If they are bored, they need to be presented with new content. Upon satisfying your users you can now ask them to take specific actions, therefore making them revisit your product, this could be in the form of retweeting or liking posts. By doing this the user becomes <span><em class="italic-text-26">invested</em></span> in the app.<br><br>Some apps also use FOMO as a way of getting us to use them more, such apps like Snapchat and Duolingo use streaks to reward you for using the app multiple days in a row. This reward encourages you to use the app more to continue this streak with friends and plays on your fear of missing out and losing the streak that you have built up. Tactics like this turn using the app into a game, a competition of sorts both with ourselves and our friends. In certain platforms, this can be very helpful as the can help create positive habits such as exercising or quitting smoking. <br>This tactic is generally known as <span><em class="italic-text-27">gamification</em></span>, how it works is by motivating the participation of the user by adding rewards and competitions of sorts to get them to keep using the app. Another example of this tactic in use is with the app Tinder, which turns dating into a game.</p>
    <div class="div-block-9"><img src="images/health.png" width="760" srcset="images/health-p-500.png 500w, images/health-p-800.png 800w, images/health-p-1080.png 1080w, images/health-p-1600.png 1600w, images/health-p-2000.png 2000w, images/health.png 2224w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 760px" alt="" class="image-14"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-28">What effects can this excess use of technology have on our health? Anderson Cooper investigated this with CBS news with the help of psychologist Larry Rosen and his team at California State University who were studying the effects of technology on our anxiety levels. What he found was that when we put down our phone, our brain signals our adrenal glands to produce a burst of a hormone called, <span><em class="italic-text-28">cortisol</em></span>, which has an evolutionary purpose in triggering our bodies fight-or-flight response to danger.<br><br>On average people checks their phone every 15 minutes and half of these times its not because we have got a notification, it is due to the fact that we have become aware that we have not checked our phones and we begin to wonder if someone has liked one of our photos or commented on a status we have posted. This feeling results in the production of cortisol which in turn makes us feel anxious and the only way to get rid of this uneasy feeling is to then check our phones and our online platforms for any activity.<br><br>Their research suggests that our phones are continually keeping us in a state of anxiety in which the only antidote – is our phones. This evidence clearly shows that the way in which we use social media and our phones can cause many health problems as well as addiction.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-6">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-29">What does this all mean? Is this harmful? Should I stop using social media? Social media is a double-edged sword; while it can help connect us and help us share our thoughts and feelings more openly, it can also have very negative effects on our health and well-being, especially our mental health. <br>Now that I have researched the reasons behind how and why we use social media, it is important to realise that it can be a powerful tool in improving our social lives and the connections that we have with others. However, we need to be conscious of the ways that we use it so that we can avoid the negative effects.<br><br>There are many pros and cons with social media and technology, personally, I don’t think that one outweighs the other, we just need to understand how to use social media in a way that allows us to experience the positive aspects so that it improves our moods, and our lives. As users, we need to realise that social media platforms are doing their best to grab our attention and influence us by purposely getting us hooked to their apps, we need to exert some control over how much, and how often we use our devices. We don’t yet know how much social media is affecting how we act or the effect it may have on us both socially and psychologically. <br>Luckily now, the need to have time away from our screens has gotten some recognition, which has resulted in <em class="italic-text-43">Apple’s Screen time feature</em>. It helps us to become aware of the amount of time that we spend on our phones and how we use it. It also helps us set boundaries on how much we want to use our devices and control how long we use certain apps. <br><br>Social media, in today&#x27;s world, plays a massive part in our lives, but who knows, maybe in 100 years we will look back at the techniques used by these companies and be shocked that they were allowed to be used at all.</p><a href="bibliography.html" class="button-2 w-button">Bibliography</a>
